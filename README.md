# Two-Box-Climate
This is a model created for the work of Sweeeney and Sura 2018 investigating the solutions for a two-box climate comprised a polar and tropic water world. Each box is coupled through a meridional heat flux, and parameterized by a relative solar intensity coefficient. The two principle schemes investigated for the meridional heat flux are a linear (based on a strictly diffusive method) and a non-linear version (includes basic principles of atmospheric dynamics). This repositiory will generate a bifurcation surface in a space with axis of relative solar intensity for each box and the equilibrium temperatures reached. Each solution also has a stability analysis associated with it, and eigenvalues are produced for each. This model has applications for not only investigating meridional heat flux, but can be used to learn about glacial periods, and parameters can be changed to match those for a different planet.

Enjoy!
